## What Is Frontend Development?

Frontend development is all about **what users see and interact with** in a web application. This includes:

* Buttons, forms, layouts
* Colors, fonts, animations
* Page navigation and interactions

### Core Frontend Technologies

Every frontend developer starts with these **three pillars**:

1. **HTML** – Structure (the skeleton)
2. **CSS** – Styling (the look & feel)
3. **JavaScript** – Behavior (logic & interaction)

Once you master these, frameworks like **React** and **Vue** become much easier to learn.
