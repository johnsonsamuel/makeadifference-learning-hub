## Your First Step: HTML Basics

HTML defines the structure of a webpage.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Frontend!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 🧪 Exercise

1. Create a file called `index.html`
2. Add:

   * Your name as a heading
   * A short paragraph about why you want to learn frontend
3. Open the file in your browser

✅ Goal: Understand how structure appears in the browser
