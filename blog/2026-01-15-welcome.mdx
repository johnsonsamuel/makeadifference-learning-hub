Welcome to makeadifference blog!!!! If you're curious about becoming a **Frontend Developer** (and eventually a Full‑Stack Developer), this starter blog is designed just for you. Think of this as a **mini‑course in blog form**—covering the *what*, *why*, and *how*, with **simple hands‑on exercises** you can practice right away.

No prior experience required—just curiosity and consistency.
